1. Start with LambdaExpressions.java.
This contains:
 - different examples of lambda expressions
 - difference between normal interface implementation and functional interface
 - Steps to create a lambda expression.
 - Steps to execute a lambda expression.

2. Refer to RunnableLambda to see how lambda expressions are used in Threads.

3. Refer to LamdaExerciseJava7 for a sample exercise implemented in Java 7

4. Refer to LambdaExcerciseJava8 for the same exercise implemented in Java 8.

5. Refer to PredicateExample for the same exercise done in Java 8 using Predicate.
java.util.function is a package that comprises of some commonly used methods. 
So, instead of creating a new interface for the sake of lambda expression, 
we can pick the appropriate functional interface from  this package and reuse them.
Predicate is one such interface which mimic ed the same behavior as that of the example 
used in Step 4.

6. Refer to ConsumerExample for another type of Functional interface.

7. Refer to ExceptionHandlingLamda to get a touch of exception handling in Lambda

8. ClosuresInLmbdas.java - Explains how we can use the local variables in lambda expressions.
The local variables are implicitly final and hence they cannot be changed in the lambda expression.
