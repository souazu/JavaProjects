Comparable Interface

1. Refer to Player class.
2. Refer to PlayerSorter class.
3. Player class implements Comparable interface.
4. Comparable interface has a single method compareTo(arg). This needs to be overridden 
in the Person Player class as it implements the Comparable interface.
5. In this example, compareTo() method compares the rank attribute and sorts according to 
the rank attribute.
	The sorting order is decided by the return value of the compareTo() method. 
	The Integer.compare(x, y) returns -1 if x is less than y, 0 if they’re equal, and 1 otherwise.

Comparator Interface
1. In the Player class, we compare using the rank attribute. 
Suppose, if we need to sort as per the name attribute or the age attribute, 
we will need to modify the Comparable interface's compareTo method.
2. Using Comparator interface, we can create different implementations such as 
AgeComparator, NameComparator or NameComparator and override the compare() method accordingly.
3. Refer to AgeComparator, NameComparator classes.
4. To use them in Collection.sort(), include the type of comparator implementation as 
an argument in Collection.sort(list, comparatorimpl)
5. Refer PlayerSorter class for the implementation.
